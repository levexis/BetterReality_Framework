This package requires the UnitySingleton git package. This needs to be installed manually.

Open package manager click + and choose from git url:

https://github.com/UnityCommunity/UnitySingleton.git

Sadly you can't specify git repos as dependencies so will need to do this. However, we may not need singletons with the use of scriptable objects.
